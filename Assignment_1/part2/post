I have a question about T array that you mentioned in the assignment text. What
prevents us from just xoring a block of plaintext and the previous ciphertext
block?

We can easily get the plaintext of the given ciphertext by just calling the
decr() function, which returns us the padded plaintext and then we can just xor
each plaintext block n with the ciphertext block n-1 to get all the 'T' blocks,
except the first one which is xored with the IV.

I can see how the method you mentioned is useful especially in situations where
we don't have direct access to decryption method and/or the plaintext, but we
can deduce whether the decryption is succedeed or failed. But in the homework
this is not the case. I don't see the need to find T array byte by byte, is
there anything that I am missing?
